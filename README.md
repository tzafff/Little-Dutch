This university project focuses on One-Dimensional programming and involves playing the game of the goose.

The game is a board game played by multiple players. Each player rolls a die and moves their piece along a snail-shaped board with 63 squares featuring various illustrations. Depending on the square they land on, players may advance or move backward, and some squares may include punishments or rewards.

During their turn, players roll two dice to determine the number of squares they can advance. The first player to reach square 63, known as "the garden of the goose," wins the game.
